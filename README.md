# CI/CD Bootcamp
## Introduction
Welcome to the CI/CD/IaC Bootcamp. The Bootcamp is a set of materials designed to teach you how to write tests for and automate the release of the things you build.

## What's in the Bootcamp
The course is being actively built out so be sure to pull regularly to get new exercises as they appear.
### Infrastructure as code
#### Ansible
#### Testing
## Getting Started
### Environment Requirements
For this material you will need the following: 
 - a *nix type environment
 - ruby
 - docker installed
 - git
 - Editor of your choice

For convenience, there's a Vagrantfile in this repository. This will build a virtual machine on your local machine with the above requirements met. You can then use `vagrant ssh` to login to the machine, clone the repo following the instructions below and work on the exercises. 
 
### Setting up 
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/lvl-up/ci-cd-training.git`
2. cd in to checkout: `cd ci-cd-training`
3. run `. ./bin/setup`
